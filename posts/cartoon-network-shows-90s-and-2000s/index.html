-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=jiggaboo-jeopardy-template>Jiggaboo Jeopardy Template<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#jiggaboo-jeopardy-template>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6193e6db2a6c635c8f3f34b9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/knd.jpeg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.PmTQ0Y21EgtVynMyUoy_QwHaEg&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="jiggaboo Jeopardy Template"><p><em>Source: jeopardylabs.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>How to watch Anime: There are many different ways to watch anime including on television, DVD, or streaming services.
